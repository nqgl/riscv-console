it seems like there's a lot of info in this project 
that we're going to want to keep track of
and like design decisions/planning
+ one of many ways of communicating/coordinating with each other

so, my current thought at an implementation of this is just  that we can put text files with information in here
    maybe have a few subdirectories for planning/details/etc?
        idk if it matters
        but this isn't the best way of doing it clearly
        so if you have any thoughts on a better way, let's do that
and of course most info is probably best in comments where it's in context

maybe even comments are sufficient on their own and a notes folder isn't necessary?
