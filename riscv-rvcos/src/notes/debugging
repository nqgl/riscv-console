I was initially just writing to the (emulated) console for debugging, just because I'd gotten the text mode working
that's very much not ideal though of course, because that interferes with the running of any of the more complex programs that use the emulated screen
so I was wanting to see if there's any way to just write to stdout or stderr or to a file, that seems like it would be really useful

this is partly a note to myself so I remember this plan
but also to you in case you know already

and to discuss debugging here, want to get your thoughts about how much/what sort of debugging infrastructure should we set up?
    

tentative plan:
    debug.c file with   
        - print function that we can use to print to stdout/stderr for basic debugging
