some notes on data segments from the .ld file

trying to understand the linking script...
    definitely not something I understand super well

there are
    _sdata
    _esdata
    _data
    _edata
these mean:
begin of .data: _data
end of .data: _edata
likewise for sdata

.sdata vs .data:
    .sdata are small data?

.bss:
    stands for "block started by symbol" apparently
        not sure yet why
