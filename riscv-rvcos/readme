using the documentation from the pdf in my source code (makes it easier to keep things straight in my head for me)

inline citation of a piazza post



https://piazza.com/class/ktlxmp9hob46o0?cid=640
piazza.com/class/ktlxmp9hob46o0?cid=338
https://piazza.com/class/ktlxmp9hob46o0?cid=338
it is very likely we mirrored variable naming patterns we saw in piazza posts, 
and though we are trying to cite any snippets used from 
piazza it is possible that we have used a snippet and missed the citation
